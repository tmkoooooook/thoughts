this app is forcused on thoughts.

## backGround
I was inspired by someone's words when I was going through a difficult time, and I wanted to create an app that would help people get in touch with their many thoughts.

I realized that my thoughts alone would never be enough to expand the world, and I knew that I was powerless in my current situation.
that's why I'm learning programing to gain power.
in the future, I am determined to contribute a lot to products through programing.
